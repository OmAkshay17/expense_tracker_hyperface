so i have implemented  backend api endppoints for expense tracker application

it includes:

-- connection to mongoDb --
add data
update data
delete data
Fetch all data

we can use postman for our api testing and running our application connects it to my mongodb 
server

then we can use
GET
PUT
POST
DELETE
requests and routes to verify our results 
this app can be scaled to more additional features and can be integrated with frontend
